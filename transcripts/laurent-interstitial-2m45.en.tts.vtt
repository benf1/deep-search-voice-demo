00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,861
Good evening and welcome to Deep Search.

2
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:06,638
That was Charles Aznavour singing "Happy Birthday."

3
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:09,875
You can probably guess why I opened the show with that.

4
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:16,583
I think many of you already know, but tonight, exactly at midnight, we cross into February 1st,

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:20,247
and me, right there, I go over the other side of the mountain.

6
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:21,694
I turn sixty.

7
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:23,444
Yeah, the big six-oh.

8
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:27,250
The kind of thing that stings your eyes a little, if we're honest.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,316
So tonight, this is a special broadcast.

10
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:33,625
That's why we shifted the show to this late slot.

11
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:40,261
Since it's my birthday, and not just any birthday, I had to mark the moment and offer you a different kind of show.

12
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:44,958
In 1966, Johnny was singing "Black Is Black."

13
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,361
Hendrix was singing "Hey Joe."

14
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:50,597
Nancy Sinatra was singing "Bang Bang."

15
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:53,472
And Carla Thomas was singing this one.

16
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,291
Carla Thomas was singing "Baby."

17
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,083
I arrived in 1966.

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:03,983
So opening with a track from '66 called "Baby" just makes sense.

19
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:06,875
Tonight, we're going to hear a lot of music.

20
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,166
A lot, a lot, truly a lot.

21
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:13,305
With the playlist I've built for you, we're spending the whole night together.

22
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,055
Yes, you heard me right.

23
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:18,791
I'm playing music for you all the way until sunrise.

24
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:25,541
We're going to travel back through time, musically, from 1966 to 2026.

25
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:29,888
Every track I picked resonates with me in a very personal way.

26
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:34,125
You never really know why one song marks you more than another,

27
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:39,541
but tonight I'm taking the chance to play only the records that I absolutely love.

28
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:45,972
And because music has that power to call back memories of a moment, a place, or a person,

29
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,736
tonight I'll play music all night and tell you stories.

30
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:55,513
The magic of songs that touch us lets our adventures stay printed in memory forever.

31
00:01:55,513 --> 00:02:02,625
And of course, given my path, many of my memories are tied to one place that means the world to me:

32
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,069
the dance floor.
